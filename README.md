# Fake_News_Classifier

I used a Passive Aggressive Classifier after concatenating the author name, title and text fields of the Kaggle Fake news dataset to get a 98.076 percent accuracy which is among the top accuracies in the kaggle competition of the same name.

A Passive Aggressive Classifier belongs to a class of online learning algorithms. It is passive for a correct classification and becomes aggressive for an incorrect classification.
